# Tandemloop-assignment
I have used python programming to complete the programs.

#Program-1
1> I have used class named Calculator and named the methods as add, subtract, multiply and divide
2> I have printed one example for each operation.
3> I have included infinity case too in the program.

#Program-2
1> The program prints the first n odd numbers in an array where n is the input.

#Program-3
1> The program prints the first n odd numbers in an array if n is odd and prints n-1 odd numbers if n is even.

#Program-4
1> This program returns the dictionary with keys of 1-9 and their corresponding sum of multiples in the given input list.
2> It consists of a nested for loop but the time complexity is still O(N) as the inner for loop executes only 9 times for any input array.
